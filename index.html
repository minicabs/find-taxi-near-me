      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">1. How do I know if a taxi is taken?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Taxis typically have a roof sign that shows whether they’re available. When the taxi is unoccupied, the light on the sign is illuminated, indicating it's ready for service.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">2. How do I order a taxi?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Customers can easily book a vehicle by calling <a href="tel:+44 208 204 4444">+44 208 204 4444 </a> or using our Smart App. Enjoy doorstep pickup at your home or office, along with free onboard Wi-Fi to stay connected throughout your journey.</p>

      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">3.How does booking a taxi work?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Booking a cab is quick and easy:
Just open the app, enter your pickup location, and adjust the pin if needed. Then, add your destination, select the type of taxi service you prefer, and choose your payment method. You can also leave a note for the driver if you like. Finally, tap “Schedule” or “I’m Ready Now” and you're all set!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">4. Is it better to book a taxi in advance?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Yes, booking a taxi in advance is often the better choice—especially during peak hours, airport transfers, or important appointments. It guarantees availability, allows you to choose your preferred vehicle, and ensures the driver arrives on time. With Minicabs.co.uk, you can pre-book 24/7 for peace of mind and fixed pricing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
        <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-700">5. Can taxi drivers ask for money upfront?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">In most cases, licensed taxi or minicab drivers in London should not ask for full payment upfront unless it’s a pre-booked journey with a fixed fare. However, some operators may request a deposit or upfront payment for long-distance or late-night trips. Always confirm the fare in advance, especially when booking through apps or private hire service</p>
